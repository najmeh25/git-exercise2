Here is a simple recipe for making Ghormeh Sabzi (Persian Herb Stew), a popular Iranian dish:

Ingredients:

	•	1 cup dried red kidney beans (or 1 can, drained)
	•	500 grams (about 1 lb) lamb or beef, cut into small cubes
	•	1 large onion, finely chopped
	•	4 cups fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, and fenugreek), chopped
	•	1/2 cup dried fenugreek leaves (optional but adds flavor)
	•	3-4 dried Persian limes (limoo amani) or 2 tbsp lime juice (adjust to taste)
	•	Salt and pepper, to taste
	•	1/2 teaspoon turmeric
	•	Cooking oil (vegetable or olive oil)
	•	Water, as needed

Instructions:

	1.	Prepare the Beans
	•	If using dried kidney beans, rinse them and soak them in water for a few hours or overnight. Then, drain and cook the beans in fresh water until soft. If using canned beans, simply rinse and drain them.
	2.	Sauté the Onion and Meat
	•	In a large pot, heat a few tablespoons of oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until golden brown.
	•	Add the turmeric and stir for a minute, then add the meat cubes and cook until browned on all sides.
	3.	Prepare the Herbs
	•	In a separate pan, heat a little more oil over medium heat. Add the chopped parsley, cilantro, and fenugreek, and sauté the herbs for about 10-15 minutes, stirring frequently until they are fragrant and slightly darker in color. (This step is essential for enhancing the flavor of the stew.)
	4.	Combine Ingredients
	•	Add the sautéed herbs, cooked kidney beans, and dried limes (pierced with a fork) to the pot with the meat and onions. Stir well.
	•	Add enough water to cover the ingredients by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer gently.
	5.	Cook the Stew
	•	Allow the stew to cook slowly for about 2-3 hours, until the meat is tender and the flavors are well combined. Check periodically, adding water if needed.
	•	Season with salt and pepper to taste, and adjust the sourness with additional lime juice if desired.
	6.	Serve
	•	Serve Ghormeh Sabzi hot, typically with steamed basmati rice.

Enjoy this delicious and traditional Persian herb stew!
